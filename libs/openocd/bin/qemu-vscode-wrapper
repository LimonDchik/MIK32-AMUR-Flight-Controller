# OpenDebugAD7 is a DAP server for VS Code that starts GDB and GDBserver.
# OpenDebugAD7 expects GDBserver to print some kind of a message to identify
# that the server is ready. QEMU doesn't do this, so we need to this script to
# print an empty line, which is enough for the OpenDebugAD7 to move forward and
# start the client.
